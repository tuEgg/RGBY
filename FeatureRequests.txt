Orb Combiner

   Shards contain a small stat bonus, the more orbs you use to create them, the more bonus they give.
   Red shards affect damage. 1 orb = +0.1% damage.
   Blue shards affect special pool. 1 orb = +0.2 special.
   Yellow shards affect reload speed. 1 orb = +0.2% reload speed.
   Green shards are used to enhance and combine shards. 10 orbs = 1 shard.
